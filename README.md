# Anycubic Integration for Home Assistant

## Installation

Custom integration to connect to the Anycubic 3D Printers that support their app.
Only just started working on this, but seem to be able to obtain some information.

## Installation

Add to HACS as custom repository:

<https://github.com/sopelj/hass-anycubic-printer-component>

And then add to your configuration.yaml and add sensors for your mug(s):

```yaml
sensors:
  - platform: anycubic
    ip_address: 192.168.2.123  # Replace with your Printer's IP Address
    port: 6000  # If your port is different from 6000
```
